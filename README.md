# PumpAndDumpPredictor
For TA: Majority of the work was done on Google Collab, uploaded code and findings here. 

Short research project by Virginia Tech Students analyzing the trends of pump and dumps and creating a model to make live predictions of pump and dump events.

## Overview
Our goal was to study pump-and-dump behavior in cryptocurrency markets and build a basic framework for detecting potential pump events using price movements, volume changes, and simple temporal features.

We collected 5-minute candle data for several tokens (PEPE, BONK, BTC, etc.) and applied threshold-based rules, anomaly detection, and simple ML models to identify abnormal spikes that could correspond to coordinated pump activity.
